# wordleBot
This was made for an individual university assignment in which I had to use Python to write an agent that could effectively play the word guessing game 'Wordle'.

Alter settings like difficulty, language, and the agent in settings.py.

I wrote 'my_agent.py', the other files were written by the lecturer.

If you want to see how it works or try to improve it, download the files and run wordle.py.
